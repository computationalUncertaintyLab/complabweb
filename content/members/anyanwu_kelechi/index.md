I am a Population Health major, minoring in Business in the College of Health at Lehigh University. My research focus is to analyze real-life data and present the data to audiences in a simple but effective way for people to understand.
My long-term goal is to get a masters in Public Health and gain experience in the field of healthcare administration and management. I also hope to pursue an MBA program and start my own health clinic to bridge the gaps of healthcare inequity.
