## Course Description
College students are at increased risk of influenza infection during their time on campus. Yet, students often have little awareness of ongoing flu activity. This course adapts successful principles from weather communication to health: weekly flu news columns, weather-style video “healthcasts,” and an interactive dashboard. Students will gain interdisciplinary skills in forecasting, communication, AV production, and evaluation. The semester culminates in an integrated communication package for the Lehigh campus.
